# Shutting Down

When you need to switch the computer off, the easiest way is to simply press the power button on the computer's case. The computer will begin shutting down and will typically power itself off within a few seconds.

In some cases, the computer may take longer to power down (for example, if a pending update is being processed). In those cases, the computer should always power off within 120 seconds.

While isotope computers should be relatively resilient against sudden power loss, it is recommended to shut down the computer using this procedure whenever possible to avoid the remote possibility of data loss.
