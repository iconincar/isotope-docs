# Desktop Mode

When enabled via [system configuration](./configuration#isotope-section) a desktop mode may be accessed using the global hotkey `Ctrl-Alt-F2`. Accessing the desktop requires logging with a password using the [admin account](./configuration#admin). The built-in desktop mode is based on [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/).

To turn off the desktop and resume running isotope, simply reboot the machine, either using the [power button](./shutting-down) or by accessing the settings menu in the upper right corner of the screen.

A common scenario in which desktop mode is helpful is when you have moved the computer and need to connect to a new wireless network. The network settings may be accessed using the settings panel by clicking in the very top right corner of the screen.
