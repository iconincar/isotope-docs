# User Guide

This guide is intended for those using isotope to create and deploy content. For information on setting up, configuring, or otherwise managing isotope computers, please refer to the [admin guide](/admin/).

Hosting content under isotope involves a few core activities:

* Creating content in one or more tools of choice: Unity, Unreal Engine, HTML5, ProtoPie, and more.
* Deploying content to the isotope computer.
* Authoring profile script(s) to define the layout and behavior of your project.

This guide will cover the basics of these activities in a tutorial format. For more in-depth information on creating profile scripts, please see the [scripting reference](/scripting/).

An isotope computer can host and run any number of different projects (henceforth referred to as "profiles") and the built-in web console makes it easy to switch between these different profiles as needed.
